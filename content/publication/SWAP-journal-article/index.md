abstract: Light signals perceived by a group of photoreceptors have profound effects on the physiology, growth, and development of plants. The red/far-red light–absorbing phytochromes (phys) modulate these aspects by intricately regulating gene expression at multiple levels. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of an RNA-binding splicing factor, SWAP1 (SUPPRESSOR-OF-WHITE-APRICOT/SURP RNA-BINDING DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN1). Loss-of-function swap1-1 mutant is hyposensitive to red light and exhibits a day length–independent early flowering phenotype. SWAP1 physically interacts with two other splicing factors, (SFPS) SPLICING FACTOR FOR PHYTOCHROME SIGNALING and (RRC1) REDUCED RED LIGHT RESPONSES IN CRY1CRY2 BACKGROUND 1 in a light-independent manner and forms a ternary complex. In addition, SWAP1 physically interacts with photoactivated phyB and colocalizes with nuclear phyB photobodies. Phenotypic analyses show that the swap1sfps, swap1rrc1, and sfpsrrc1 double mutants display hypocotyl lengths similar to that of the respective single mutants under red light, suggesting that they function in the same genetic pathway. The swap1sfps double and swap1sfpsrrc1 triple mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes, including sterility at the adult stage. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses show that SWAP1 regulates the gene expression and pre–messenger RNA (mRNA) alternative splicing of a large number of genes, including those involved in plant responses to light signaling. A comparative analysis of alternative splicing among single, double, and triple mutants showed that all three splicing factors coordinately regulate the alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Our study uncovered the function of a splicing factor that modulates light-regulated alternative splicing by interacting with photoactivated phyB and other splicing factors.
