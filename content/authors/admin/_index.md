I am a molecular biologist that recently finished my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at UT Austin, where I used big-data approaches to biology to better understand how genes interact and contribute to an organism's growth. During my degree, I developed strong data analysis skills through processing, analyzing and drawing conclusions from next-generation sequencing data. I'm passionate about applying my data analysis skills towards new problems and investigating the roles of genes in development and disease.
